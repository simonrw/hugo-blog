This is not a blog post as such, it's the notes that I took during the conference split up into sections. Unfortunately there is no reference to the talk content itself; this is kept in the booklet which I have sitting next to me as I type this.


## Session 1

### Detecting and characterising via direct imaging

* More than 2Gyr gas giants more than 10^8 times fainter than primary
* Young stars are 10^4 - 10^7 times better than this
* Chronograph for increasing contrast
* Speckle noise a big problem
    * for speckle based data S/N does not increase with time
    * angular differential imaging
        * speckles oscillate while image rotates, but keep similar shape
        * real objects will move in the frame
* A stars good targets despite being bright
    * higher hosting fraction for giant planets for A stars (not sure about this)
    * high profile detections 
    * Nielsen show low host fraction despite this
* M stars also good targets
    * despite low independent host fraction
* Typical contrasts - 10^5 at 1 arcsecond (with NICI)


#### Physical properties (atmospheres)

* Direct photons detected from these objects
    * reflected light and background contaminants surely?
* Colours in infra-red shows deviations from the predicted T dwarf type sequence (brightness vs colour)
    * more like L dwarfs
    * much lower surface gravity
* Direct spectra taken (!)
* Huge spectral diversity for planets even in same system
* Surface gravity strongly affecting the spectra
* Orbits of Beta Pic 2 - Chauvin et al. 2012
    * most probable semi major axis

#### Architecture

* Upper limits to abundance
* Cold start - less than  10% for separations 20 - 630 AU
* Hot start - less than 10% for separations 10 - 810 AU
* Gravitational instability planets rare at more than 10 AU
* Scattering planets also rare
* Sphere project - 10 - 80 more planets
* Possible detection of Super-Earth around nearby M dwarf (Crossfield, Goyon et al. 2013)

#### Summary

* Young exoplanets have red colours consistent with dusty clouds and non-equilibrium chemistry
* Hot start gas giant planets more than 4 MJup rare at more than 10AU

### International deep planet survey

* Homogeneous analysis methods 

### SEEDS

* Strategic Explorations of Exoplanets and discs with Subaru
* Variety in morphology of protoplanetary discs
    * gaps, non-uniform shapes
* IRD - IR doppler instrument on Subaru
    * could be good for follow up for NGTS, investigate this
    * [paper](https://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012SPIE.8446E..1TT)

### Hershell dust evolution in discs

* SED modelling and Herschel tracing dust evolution in discs


###Planet formation in evolving protoplanetary discs 

* Gas dominates planetary formation
* Planets form in evolving discs
* Disc dispersal quick and efficient
    * relatively few systems found with partial discs
* Accretion in disc core, with photoevaporation at higher disc heights
* Changes in disc structure can form traps for dust or planets
* Final gas disc dispersal halts planet migration
* **Giant planet migration can be halted if the disc gas is dispersed**
* *RDA & Armitage 2009*, RDA and Pascucci 2012
* Pile up observed in models and data at 1-2AU
    * looks like a possible pile up at smaller separations also

### Disc inhomogeneities and the origins of planetary system architectures and observational properties 

* Discs have 3 types of planet trap

### HST/STIS imaging of Fomaulhaut: New main belt structure and confirmation of Fomalhaut b’s eccentric orbit

* Highly eccentric 0.8
* A ~= 1.77
* Periastron: 32AU
* P ~= 1700 years
* Dynamically linked with belt
    * mutual inclination (planet - belt) ~ 17 degrees
    * Periastron linked
* Gap in main belt of ~50AU
* Inner belt detected
* Planet planet scattering: Chatterjee et al. 2008

### Highlights of Exoplanet Characterization

* Planets are diverse in Teff(planet) vs IR colour, no clear pattern yet
* Uranus and Neptune heavily enriched in carbon (50x) 
    * also very old, about 50K
* Consistent non-detection of CO in GJ436
* Featureless atmosphere of GJ1214b suggests high mean molecular weight 
    * dramatic cloud obscuration

## Session 2

### Review

* Radio maps more than 95% of mass
    * good for structure

### Triggered planet formation in action: resolved gas and dust images of a transitional disk and its activity

* Surface density excess after a planetary body traps large dust particles in a potential maximum
* Increased density leads to planet formation

## Session 3

### Review - The story of planets: anchoring numerics to reality

* Hubble protoplanetary disk atlas - nice pictures
* Disc gaps depend on grain size - different wavelengths probe grain size and gap width
* Grain growth drives planetessimal (~km sized) formation 
    * not reliable
* Pairwise accretion - slow, turbulence high, has issues
    * requires velocity dispersion/distribution in simulations
        * mean velocity is not enough for an accurate simulation
    * requires grain size distribution
* Pressure bumps trap dust
    * leads to further processes, gravitational instability, accretion
* Accretion very low fraction of simulated collisions
* Dust distribution dependant on planetessimal eccentricity


### Zooming in on protoplanetary discs

* Magnetic fields in star forming region does not create planar disc initially
    * vertical structure is created
* Free-fall accretion guided by magnetic field

### Planetessimal formation

* Disc cross section 
    * core stable
    * edges suffer instability
* Planet trend with instability
    * mostly requires *local* Disk metalicity, could be super-solar


## Session 5

    * simultaneous observations
    * RV profile then contains both stellar noise and planet
    * use lightcurve as basis function

## Session 8 - evolution of planetary systems


### Review


* Interesting deficit of period ratios in Kepler dataset just below 2:1
* Resonances cause oscillations of the periastron points of a multiple system
    * non-resonances cause circulation
* If the system is not stable with aligned systems (angle of periastrons equal) then all other configurations will be unstable
* No close encounter required
* Hill radius associated with circular orbits
* Dissipation acts to stabilise systems
* HAT-P-13 is multiple planet system
    * why does WASP not find any?
    * consider changing wasp pipeline to subtract the in-transit data and re-perform search N times
* MMR Lithwick
* Could the Kepler distance from pure resonances be due to unseen non-transiting bodies?


### Constraining planetary migration mechanisms in systems of giant planets 

* Dawson and Johnson 2012 - predicting eccentricity from Kepler lightcurves
* Metal-poor and metal-rich lead to disk migration
    * only metal rich stars form multiple systems
* Fressin et al. 2013 - kepler occurrence rates
* Possible pile up at short periods for metal rich Kepler host stars
* How do eccentric planets in the period valley between 0.1 and 1 AU form?
* Planet planet scattering possibly ejecting outer planet removing it from evidence for it

### The Impact of Stellar Multiplicity on Planetary Systems

* High protoplanetary disc occurrence for wide binary planets
    * distinct decrease below binary star separations of ~40AU
* Similarly decreasing disc mass with decreasing orbital separation
* RV surveys biased against binary stars due to the stray light from the binary companion in the slit
* Only equal flux binaries at short separations
    * selection effect?
        * maybe planets form around the fainter secondary and are therefore harder to detect so we don't find them

### Orbital structure of Kepler Planetary Systems

* Low mass planets targeted for the talk
    * less than ~30Mearth
* Fortney 07 density structures
* Bimodal small radius distribution 
    * can be split by the x-ray exposure
* TTV mass estimations extremely sensitive to eccentricity

### Archaeology of Exo-Terrestrial Planetary Systems

* RECONS project - spectral types within 10pc
