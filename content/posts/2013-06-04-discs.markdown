So today we learnt about discs, as the title of this post may suggest. We had
protoplanetary discs (or proplyds which is a horrible portmanteau), thin discs,
thick discs, transitional discs...

This mostly involved theorists and simulations working their hardest, but we did
get a few observational results thrown in for good measure. To be fair it's a
simulation type topic, current methods are not powerful enough without some
serious and therefore expensive time on the largest telescopes. Some nice
analysis advances are being made but for once[^1] observationalists have to play
catch up.

We finished with a public talk from Debra Fischer and a slightly US-centred view
on the history of exoplanet discovery. There was one nice picture of Mayor and
Queloz by the telescope. A good day in all.

[^1]: I am exaggerating here for effect.
