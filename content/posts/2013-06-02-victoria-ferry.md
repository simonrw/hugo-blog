The ferry from Vancouver to Vancouver island (not *Victoria island*, as I've been told) was amazing. The scenery was breathtaking, photos of which I shall upload later. The little islands around Vancouver island were amazing to see, really fantastic. The map is centred on Victoria itself but the islands are to the north east.

We're sitting on a coach waiting to depart to Victoria town centre, ready to find our hotel and work out where the conference centre is.
