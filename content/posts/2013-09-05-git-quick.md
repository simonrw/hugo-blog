Git quick is a simple shell command I've written for quicker one line messages. It allows committing like

``` bash
g q A simple commit message
```

Note the lack of quotes.  Some things I've used to make it quicker:

* alias git to g in my zshrc
* alias q to quick in my gitconfig file
* put the `git-quick` script into my path somewhere

### The script

The script really can't be much simpler:

{{< gist mindriot101 6456980 >}}

(gisted for quick cloning)

I only learnt about git cleverly loading any executable `git-*` script, and it simply expands any arguments into the commit message.

Note: this can be even quicker if you alias git quick to a single letter in your zshrc e.g. `alias gq='git quick'` or `alias q='git quick'` but this seems a bit silly to me. 




*WARNING: this increases the likelihood of commit messages like "stuff" or "commit" as it makes it really easy to write short informative messages, so I implore you to use this newly gained power wisely.*
