summary: My thoughts on implementing a toy trustfall project

[Trustfall][trustfall] is a GraphQL query engine, but without the web stuff meaning it is really designed for performing queries on data.
An example application is given in ["How to Query (Almost) Everything"](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/trustfall?tab=readme-ov-file#10min-tech-talk--demo) which shows combining multiple data sources:

* Hacker News posts
* GitHub projects
* GitHub actions jobs
