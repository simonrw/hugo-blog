So we're at the airport. Mostly uneventful journey so far, luckily. Airports terrify me; flying doesn't scare me at all, but the chance of being rejected for something as simple as forgetting your passport is so unnerving.

I've been up since 6am this morning, which is pretty tough. I've managed to get some free wifi at the airport, ironically from BT Openzone which have announced that they're [closing to O2 customers](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-22728977). This is ironic for two reasons:

1. As an O2 customer I was not aware of this ability before today (ok this is not technically irony)
2. I'm checking the internet through BT OpenZone as we speak!

In other news, much more sad this time, a co-founder of the fantastic Oculus Rift was announced to be the [pedestrian who was killed recently in a police chace](https://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/local/orange_county&id=9122999). I'm not sure how this will affect the company, or the development of the rift as a whole; I've not been following development but I've heard some good things about it from many sources.

About to board the plane soon, then the long flight where my laptop battery will be tested to its limits. Another post soon, providing I can get some time. So much learning to be done.
